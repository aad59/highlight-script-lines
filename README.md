# Automated Script Highlighting: Gloria, *By the Way, Meet Vera Stark*

This project is a Python program designed to highlight all of Gloria's lines in the play *By the Way, Meet Vera Stark* written by Lynn Nottage. As someone cast in the role of Gloria, I created this tool to automate the tedious task of highlighting lines, ensuring accuracy and saving time.

## Features

- **Automated Line Highlighting:** The program scans the play's text and highlights all lines spoken by Gloria.
- **Accuracy:** Eliminates the risk of missing lines that can occur with manual highlighting.
- **Libraries Used:** Utilizes `pymupdf` for PDF processing and `re` for regular expression matching.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pymupdf` library
- `re` library (part of Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aad59/gloria-line-highlighter.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pymupdf
   ```
