# Automated Script Highlighting: Gloria, *By the Way, Meet Vera Stark*

This project is a Python program designed to highlight all of Gloria's lines in the play *By the Way, Meet Vera Stark* written by Lynn Nottage. I created this tool to automate the tedious task of highlighting my lines, ensuring accuracy and eliminating potential stress over missed cues in future rehearsals. 

See `vera_stark.pdf` to view the input file and `gloria.pdf` to view the output file.

## Libraries
